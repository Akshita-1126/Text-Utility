My First Django Website

Views.py contain the backend programming. <br>
url.py contain the navigation path and patterns. <br>
Index.html contain the frontend of the website (I kept the frontend straigthforward because i was more focused on learning the framework). <br>
analyzed.html contain the frontend of the result.

This is my first django website after learning it from past 2 weeks.<br>
Thank you!
