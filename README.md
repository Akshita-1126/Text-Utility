My First Django Website

Views.py contain the backend programming.
url.py contain the navigation path and patterns.
Index.html contain the frontend of the website (I kept the frontend straigthforward because i was more focused on learning the framework).
analyzed.html contain the frontend of the result.

This is my first django website after learning it from past 2 weeks.
Thank you!
